- **`docker-compose.yml`** - Easy local testing and deployment
- **`.dockerignore`** - Optimizes Docker build

### Automation
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** - Automated release pipeline
- **`release.sh`** - One-command release script
- **`DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Complete deployment documentation

### Documentation
- **`AUTOMATION_SUMMARY.md`** - This file

## 🎯 How to Create a Release

### Super Easy Method (Recommended)

```bash
# Make script executable (first time only)
chmod +x release.sh

# Create a release
./release.sh 1.0.0
```

That's it! Everything else is automatic.

### What Happens Automatically

1. ✅ Commits your changes
2. ✅ Pushes to GitHub
3. ✅ Creates git tag
4. ✅ Triggers GitHub Actions
5. ✅ Builds Docker image → Pushes to GitHub Container Registry
6. ✅ Builds Linux executable → Attaches to GitHub release
7. ✅ Builds Windows executable → Attaches to GitHub release
8. ✅ Creates GitHub release page with download links

**Total time:** ~20-30 minutes (automated)

## 📊 What Users Get

### Option 1: Docker (Best for most users)
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/yourusername/ai-image-tagger:1.0.0
docker run --gpus all -p 5000:5000 ghcr.io/yourusername/ai-image-tagger:1.0.0
```

### Option 2: Executables (No Docker needed)
- Download from GitHub Releases
- Windows: `ai-image-tagger-windows.zip`
- Linux: `ai-image-tagger-linux.tar.gz`

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

```
You: ./release.sh 1.0.0
  ↓
GitHub Actions starts building
  ↓
20-30 minutes later...
  ↓
Release is live!
  ├─ Docker image: ghcr.io/yourusername/ai-image-tagger:1.0.0
  ├─ Linux executable: ai-image-tagger-linux.tar.gz
  └─ Windows executable: ai-image-tagger-windows.zip
```

## 🎬 Step-by-Step First Release

### 1. Test Your Code
```bash
# Test locally
cd backend
python app.py
# Verify it works
```

### 2. Create Release
```bash
# Run the release script
./release.sh 1.0.0
```

### 3. Monitor Build
- Go to GitHub → Actions tab
- Watch the build progress (takes ~20-30 minutes)

### 4. Verify Release
- Go to GitHub → Releases
- You should see:
  - Release v1.0.0
  - `ai-image-tagger-linux.tar.gz`
  - `ai-image-tagger-windows.zip`
- Go to GitHub → Packages
  - You should see Docker image

### 5. Make Docker Image Public (First time only)
1. Go to GitHub profile → Packages
2. Click `ai-image-tagger`
3. Package settings → Change visibility → Public

### 6. Test Docker Image
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/yourusername/ai-image-tagger:1.0.0
docker run --gpus all -p 5000:5000 ghcr.io/yourusername/ai-image-tagger:1.0.0
```

## 📝 Version Numbering

- `v1.0.0` - Major release
- `v1.1.0` - New features
- `v1.0.1` - Bug fixes
- `v1.0.0-beta` - Pre-release

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Manual Trigger via GitHub
1. Go to Actions → "Build and Release"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter version and type
4. Click "Run workflow"

### Create Pre-release
```bash
./release.sh 1.0.0-beta prerelease
```

### Update Existing Installation
```bash
# Docker
docker pull ghcr.io/yourusername/ai-image-tagger:latest
docker-compose restart

# Executable
# Just download new version from Releases
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Test Docker build locally: `docker build -t test .`
- Test PyInstaller build: `./build-executable.sh`

### Docker Image Not Found
- Make sure package is public (see step 5 above)
- Check package name matches your repository

### Release Script Errors
- Make sure you're on main branch
- Commit all changes first
- Check git is configured correctly

- **README.md** - User documentation
- **QUICKSTART.md** - End-user quick start

## 💡 Tips

1. **Test locally before releasing** - Save time debugging
2. **Use semantic versioning** - Users know what changed
3. **Write release notes** - Users appreciate knowing what's new
4. **Don't delete old releases** - Users may need them
5. **Use pre-releases for testing** - Beta test before stable release

## 🎉 Benefits

### Before
- Manual builds on each platform
- Manual uploads to releases
- Inconsistent environments
- Time-consuming releases

### After
- ✅ One command releases everything
- ✅ Automatic builds for all platforms
- ✅ Consistent Docker images
- ✅ Releases in 20-30 minutes (automated)
- ✅ Users get Docker OR executables
- ✅ Easy updates
